Some common steps in a CI setup include linting, testing, and building. What are
the specific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of the
language you picked? You can search for the answers by Google.

- I chose Python so to do linting for python I use black8. For testing I use
  pytest

What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions?
Again, you can ask Google!

- I use Gitlab to set up the CI

Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why?
What information would you need to make that decision?

- Using Gitlab so I think it is a cloud-based env. Because I think using
  cloud-based will help me with less configuration.
